# PCAcars
2004 American car data analysis

## Technologies
R

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- R (version 4.1.2 tested)

I realized a PCA on the car dataset in order to reduce the number of features used to describe them.
In that way, I can make group of car regarding more high level and relevant features. These features can be : 
luxuary cars, city car, ...
